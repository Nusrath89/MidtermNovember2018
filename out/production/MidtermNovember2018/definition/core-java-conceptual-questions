Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A.A programming language is a formal language, which comprises a set of instructions used to produce various kinds of output.
Programming languages are used in computer programming to create programs that implement specific algorithms
What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A.JDK is a Java Developer's Key consisted of a comprehensive set of tools, utilities, documentation, and sample code for developing Java programs.
The main components of JDK are as follows;
1)The Runtime Interpreter
A A Runtime interpreter or Java virtual machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode.
2)The Compiler
 A compiler in java is a program that takes the text file work of a developer and compiles it into a platform-independent Java file.
3)The Applet Viewer
The appletviewer command allows you to run applets outside of a web browser.
4)The Debugger
Debugging is the process of fixing bugs or errors present in the code or a project. Debugging, in other words, improves the quality of the code.
5)The Class File Disassembler
It prints out the disassembled code.
6)The Header and Stub File Generator
In order to implement native methods in a programme,the C header and source files are created that are used by C programs to reference instance variables of an object from native source code.
7)The Documentation Generator
The Documentation Generator is a process that parses the documentation comments in Java source files while producing a set of HTML pages explaining the public and protected classes, inner classes, interfaces, constructors, methods, and fields.
8)Applet Demos
An applet needs to be runned in a Web browser and can be a fully functional Java application because it has the entire Java API at its disposal.
9)API Source Code
API is an application programming interface (API) presenting a set of definitions, communication protocols, and tools for building software.

A. Programs that are declared as an application entry point must have a unique PROGRAM resource name in your environment.
To enable these programs to be called from outside the application, they must be public resources.
Why main is static?
A. The keyword static allows main to be called without having to instantiate a particular instance of the class. Without having declared main method static , your program will successfully compile but won't execute and report error at run time.
The keyword void simply tells the compiler that main does not return a value.

what is Access Specifier?
A. Access specifier is keywords in object-oriented languages that set the accessibility of classes, methods, and other members
What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A. Object oriented programming - Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and polymorphism.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A. A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. java.lang package is imported by default.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A. Application Programming Interface, we used java API.
Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A. Java does not support the multiple inheritance. instead it supports multi interfaces.
What is method overloading and when it happens?
A. Method overloading is a polymorphism aspect that change the logic of the method.
Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A. Exception is eventual errors that can operate on java, we handle them by the try/catch method.
What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A. The static keyword in java is used for memory management mainly. The static keyword belongs to the class than instance of the class variable.
What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A. Final is java keyword that makes variables and methods not changeable.
What is final, finally and finalize?
A. Final is an entity definer
       - Finally is a block to access some block as the closing one.
           - Finalize is a package called by the garbage collector on an object.

What is a constructor ?
A. Constructor is a block of code called when an instance of object created.
Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A. YES WE CAN
If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A. The default Constructor.
What is "this" keyword in java ?
A. This is a keyword that refers to the reference variable.
What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A.Super is keyword that calls the variables, constructor or methods from the child class to parent class.

What is JAR stand for ?
A. Java Archive
What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
JVM is the machine while JDK is the whole java program.
What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A. JRE is the container, JVM is the content.
What is compile time and run time?
A. Compile time is the when we write the code and the run time is when we read the code.
What is heap?
A. The heap is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated.
How java manage it's memory?
A. By collecting Deleted item once object are not in need anymore.
What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A. String once assigned can not be changed. StringBuffer is mutable means one can change the value of the object .

A. A class that can be used once.
What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A. Serialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams.

What is JIT stands for?
A. Just I =n Time.
Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?

A. NO.
What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A. Whenever an object is created, it's always stored in the Heap space and stack memory contains the reference to it.
Stack memory only contains local primitive variables and reference variables to objects in heap space.
What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
A. Java Reflection makes it possible to inspect classes, interfaces, fields and methods at runtime, without knowing the names of the classes, methods and it is useful because it supports dynamic retrieval of information about classes and data structures by name, and allows for their manipulation within an executing Java program.

A. Static binding in Java occurs during compile time while dynamic binding occurs during runtime.
